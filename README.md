# Assembler-ASM-to-BIN
ssembler for a CPU that converts assembly code into binary machine code in two passes:  In the first pass, the assembler generates a symbol table mapping labels to memory addresses. In the second pass, it replaces labels with their corresponding addresses and converts the instructions into binary.
